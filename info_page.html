        <p> You are being invited to participate in a research study where you will be asked to read and annotate comics pages. </p>
        
        <p> You are asked to read a 5 page sci-fi fantasy comic and carefully outline each area within each panel that you think depicts a drawing of an <b>animate person, object, or thing.</b>  <p>
        <!--
        <p> In this study, you are asked to read a 5 page sci-fi fantasy comic and indicate on a 5-point scale whether the background of each panel has no information about the setting (blank), or contains a lot of information (full drawing). </p>
         -->
        <p> Before you decide whether or not you wish to participate in this study, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve.
