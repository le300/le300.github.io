        <p> You are being invited to participate in a research study where you will be asked to read and annotate some comics pages. </p>
        <p> In this study, you are asked to read a 5 page sci-fi fantasy comic and indicate on a 5-point scale whether the background of each panel has no information about the setting (blank), or contains a lot of information (full drawing). </p>
        <p> Before you decide whether or not you wish to participate in this study, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the Participant Information Sheet carefully, which you can download <a id="info_sheet_download" onclick="checkInfoPageDownloaded()" href="2_Forms/Participant_Information_Sheet.pdf" download target="_blank">here</a>. Please feel free to ask us questions if there is anything that is not clear, or if you would like more information. </p>
        <p> Participation is entirely voluntary. Refusal to participate requires no reason, and consent to participate can be revoked at any time. </p>
