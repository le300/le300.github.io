        <p> Comics are made of sequences of images. The images in comics often show the setting of where the action is taking place, or where the characters are situated - however, sometimes the background is not shown (it seems to "drop out"), or is not very detailed and there are gaps in the setting.  </p>
        
        <p> You are to indicate whether the background of each panel <b>does NOT contain information</b> about the location and setting (0), or <b>does contain information</b> about the location and setting (1). To make this assessment, disregard all the text sections, characters, and any objects the characters are interacting with, and only judge the remaining visual elements.
            </p>
            
        <p> You are provided the comic pages and a slider per each panel in the comic to assign each panel a score - note that each slider section on the right matches to a numbered panel on the comic image on the left, as shown in the image below. </p>
        
        <!--
        <p> You are to indicate whether the background of each panel has <b>no information about the setting </b> and is blank, or contains <b>a lot of information </b> as a full drawing (5), or is <b>somewhere in between</b> (2-4) and provides some information on location and setting. </p>
        <p> You are provided the comic pages and a slider per each panel in the comic to assign each panel a score - note that each slider section on the right matches to a numbered panel on the comic image on the left, as shown in the image below. </p>

        <ul id="instruction_notes">
            <li> DO NOT refresh the page, or use the forward and backwards browser buttons. Your results will not be collected!
            <li> Disregard the characters, text, speech bubbles, and sound effects when judging background information.  </li>
            <li> Also disregard any objects that characters are holding or interacting with as well - these are not part of the setting or location. </li>
            <li> Judge each panel separately. </li>
            <li> Think about whether you would know the location of that section from the image in that section alone without considering the previous or next sections.</li>
