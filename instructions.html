        <p> Comics are comprised of image sequences. The images have the potential to depict all sorts of stories, including fantasical scenarios that would be impossible in reality! Many science fiction and fairy tale stories, for instance, include things like talking animals, zombies and aliens.  </p>
        
        <!-- Comics are made of sequences of images. The images in comics often show the setting of where the action is taking place, or where the characters are situated - however, sometimes the background is not shown (it seems to "drop out"), or is not very detailed and not much is drawn to show the setting. -->
        
     <!--   <p> In this study, you are to carefully outline every part of each image that depicts something animate. The definition of an animate for this study is: <b>a depiction of an entity that displays human or higher animal-like behaviours, or can communicate autonomously and move intentionally. </b> </p> -->
        
        <p> In this study, you are given comic pages that have some parts of the drawing outlined in purple. You are to decide whether these drawings show something that is animate, and if so, give the type of animacy. The definition of animate for this study is: <b>a depiction of an entity that displays human or higher animal-like behaviours, or can communicate autonomously and move intentionally. </b> You are also asked to give each outline a <b>label</b> so the animate entities can be tracked across the whole story.</p>
        
        <p> You are provided an interface that shows the comic page on the left. Each panel is outlined in red, and has a corresponding section on the right with a matching number. Within each section are purple subsections. The numbers on the purple sections correspond to the numbers on the purple outlines. See the image below. </p>
        
        <!--
        <p> You are to indicate on a <b>5-point spectrum</b> whether the background of each panel has <b>no information about the setting </b> and is blank (1), or contains <b>a lot of information </b> as a full drawing (5), or is <b>somewhere in between</b> to provide some information on location and setting. </p>
        <p> You are provided the comic pages and a slider per each panel in the comic to assign each panel a score - note that each slider section on the right matches to a numbered panel on the comic image on the left, as shown in the image below. </p>
         -->
        
        <div id="CAT_examples_container">

        </div>
        <br></br>
        
        <p>In each purple section, you are to select one option from a set of choices about the type of animacy shown in the drawing within the corresponding outline. Once you select an option, another, darker-purple form will appear. This form prompts you to assign a label to the drawing. Each animate person or thing is given a unique label that follows them throughout the story; for instance, if the same person is drawn in panel 1 and panel 2, both outlined should be given the same label (e.g. X1).</p>
        
        
        <!--
        <p> Once you press "Start Outlining Animate Areas" button in a section, you will be able to outline areas directly on the comic page image in the panel that corresponds to the section. You can make lines by <b>Clicking directly</b> on the image (not clicking and dragging), and erase a line by pressing the <b>Backspace Key</b>. You can close the shape by pressing the <b>Enter Key</b> where you want to end the outline. Once you see the outline number, this means you have successfully made a completed outline! Use the buttons in each section to start and end the task per section, and also remove the last completed outline in that section. </p>
         
         <p> It is totally fine if the outlines overlap. </p>
         
         -->
        
        <p> Please fill out each section <b>in the order that you would see or read them</b> the best you can. </p>
        
        <p> Also keep in mind that something that is inanimate in one panel may become animate in a later panel, or change in appearance. Try to focus on one panel at a time. </p>
        
        <!-- Move each slider left and right to assign the associated panel a score between 1 and 5, as shown below. -->

            <li> DO NOT refresh the page, or use the forward and backwards browser buttons. Your results will not be collected if you use the browser navigation buttons!
            <li> Instead, use the navigation button under the blue sections on the right side of the interface. Thanks :)

            <li> Disregard the characters, text, speech bubbles, and sound effects when judging background information.  </li>
            <li> Also disregard any objects that characters are holding or interacting with as well - these are not part of the setting or location. </li>
            <li> Judge each panel separately. </li>
            <li> Think about whether you would know the location of that section from the image in that section alone without considering the previous or next sections.</li>
