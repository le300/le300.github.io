        <p> Comics are made of sequences of images. The images in comics often show the setting of where the action is taking place, or where the characters are situated - however, sometimes the background is not shown (it seems to "drop out"), or is not very detailed and not much is drawn to show the setting.  </p>
        <p> You are to indicate on a <b>5-point scale</b> whether the background of each panel has <b>no information about the setting </b> and is blank (1), or contains <b>a lot of information </b> as a full drawing (5), or is <b>somewhere in between</b> (2-4) and provides some information on location and setting. </p>
        <p> You are provided the comic pages and a slider per each panel in the comic to assign each panel a score - note that each slider section on the right matches to a numbered panel on the comic image on the left, as shown in the image below. </p>

        <p>Move each slider left and right to assign the associated panel a score between 1 and 5, as shown below.</p>

        <ul id="instruction_notes">
            <li> DO NOT refresh the page, or use the forward and backwards browser buttons. Your results will not be collected!
            <li> Disregard the characters, text, speech bubbles, and sound effects when judging background information.  </li>
            <li> Also disregard any objects that characters are holding or interacting with as well - these are not part of the setting or location. </li>
            <li> Judge each panel separately. </li>
            <li> Think about whether you would know the location of that section from the image in that section alone without considering the previous or next sections.</li>
